"Mass gathering medicine, also known as event medicine, crowd medicine or mass gathering health, is a field of medicine that explores the health effects/risks of mass gatherings and the strategies that contribute positively to effective health services delivery during these events.",Mass gathering medicine

the weather,
duration of the event,
if the crowd moves,
containment of the event (fenced/contained or not),
availability of alcohol/drugs,
the density of the crowd et al.,
possibility for spreading of communicable diseases Key purposes of Mass Gathering Medical  Services at an event are:
rapid access to the injured or ill patients,
effective stabilizing and transporting injured or ill patients,
on-site care for minor injuries and illnesses.The Department of Global Alert and Response of the World Health Organization supports Member States hosting mass gatherings.",Mass gathering medicine

"A ground rule double is a baseball rule that awards two bases from the time of pitch to all baserunners including the batter-runner, as a result of the ball leaving play after being hit fairly and leaving the field under a condition of the ground rules in effect at the field where the game is being played.",Ground rule double
"An automatic double is the term used to refer to a fairly hit ball leaving the field in circumstances that do not merit a home run, such as when the ball's first bounce was within the field.",Ground rule double
The automatic double (or rule-book double) is quite often mistakenly called a ground rule double.,Ground rule double
"Application
Major League Baseball (MLB) has a set of universal ground rules that apply at all ballparks, two of which award two bases to the batter and any baserunners:
A batted ball lodged in the roof above fair territory (unless outlined otherwise in the home park ground rules)
Any batted ball in fair territory that, in flight, strikes the facing of a lower wall and then bounds over a higher wall
Two bases can also be awarded per home park ground rules—rules created to provide for unique playing conditions of a specific ballpark.",Ground rule double
"For example, ground rules govern the situation when a batted ball is lodged in the ivy at Wrigley Field, or the walkways near the ceiling of Tropicana Field, a domed stadium.The far more commonly occurring automatic double results from the generally applicable MLB rules 5.05(a)(6) through 5.05(a)(9).",Ground rule double

"Quantum spin tunneling, or quantum tunneling of magnetization,  is a physical phenomenon by which the quantum mechanical state that describes the collective magnetization of a nanomagnet  is a linear superposition of two states with well defined and opposite magnetization.",Quantum spin tunneling
"Classically,  the  magnetic anisotropy favors neither of the two states with opposite magnetization, so that the system has two equivalent  ground states.",Quantum spin tunneling
"Because of the quantum spin tunneling, an energy splitting between the bonding and anti-bonding linear combination of states with opposite magnetization  classical ground states arises, giving rise to a unique ground state separated by the first excited state by   an energy difference  known as quantum spin tunneling splitting.",Quantum spin tunneling
The quantum spin tunneling splitting  also occurs for pairs of excited states with opposite magnetization.,Quantum spin tunneling
"As a consequence of quantum spin tunneling,  the magnetization of a system can switch between states with opposite magnetization that are separated by an energy barrier much larger than thermal energy.",Quantum spin tunneling

Mineral microstructures
Planar fractures
Planar fractures are parallel sets of multiple planar cracks or cleavages in quartz grains; they develop at the lowest
pressures characteristic of shock waves (~5–8 GPa) and a common feature of quartz grains found associated with impact structures.",Shock metamorphism
"Although the occurrence of planar fractures is relatively common in other deformed rocks, the development of intense, widespread, and closely spaced planar fractures is considered diagnostic of shock metamorphism.",Shock metamorphism
"Planar deformation features
Planar deformation features, or PDFs, are optically recognizable microscopic features in grains of silicate minerals (usually quartz or feldspar), consisting of very narrow planes of glassy material arranged in parallel sets that have distinct orientations with respect to the grain's crystal structure.",Shock metamorphism

PROSTVAC is a vaccine designed to enable the immune system to recognize and attack prostate cancer cells by triggering a specific and targeted T cell immune response to cancer cells that express the tumor-associated antigen prostate-specific antigen (PSA).,Prostvac
"PROSTVAC utilizes recombinant poxviruses that express PSA, along with 3 immune-enhancing costimulatory molecules collectively designated as TRICOM (LFA-3, ICAM-1, and B7.1) to stimulate an immune response.",Prostvac
"Treatment is initiated by subcutaneous administration of a priming dose of vaccinia encoding PSA-TRICOM, followed by 6 subsequent boosting doses of fowlpox encoding the same PSA-TRICOM cassette.",Prostvac
"Using this heterologous prime-boost dosing regimen, the immune system becomes focused on inducing PSA-specific T cell responses, designed to kill tumor cells expressing PSA.",Prostvac

"The phrase is referenced, even beyond the educational context, as a sarcastic rejoinder to any similarly glib or otherwise insufficient or implausible explanation for a failure in any context.",The dog ate my homework
The claim of a dog eating one's homework is inherently suspect since it is both impossible for a teacher to disprove and conveniently absolves the student who gives that excuse of any blame.,The dog ate my homework
"However, although suspicious, the claim is not absolutely beyond possibility since dogs are known to eat—or chew on—bunches of paper; John Steinbeck was once forced to ask his editor for additional time due to half the manuscript of Of Mice and Men having been eaten by his Irish Setter.As an explanation for missing documents, it dates to a story about a Welsh minister first recorded in print in 1905.",The dog ate my homework

"A stub file is a computer file that appears to the user to be on disk and immediately available for use, but is actually held either in part or entirely on a different storage medium.",Stub file
"When a stub file is accessed, device driver software intercepts the access, retrieves the data from its actual location and writes it to the file, then allows the user's access to proceed.",Stub file
"Typically, users are unaware that the file's data is stored on a different medium, though they may experience a slight delay when accessing such a file.File stubbing, the act of creating stub files, is a Hierarchical storage management (HSM) concept.",Stub file
"Purpose
The usual purpose of stubbing files is to move data from an expensive high-speed storage device such as a computer's hard drive to lower cost storage such as a magnetic tape, or an electro-optical disk, while not requiring users to know how to use specialised storage software to retrieve the data.",Stub file
"It also allows a system manager to enforce the use of low cost storage when users would prefer to store their files on the highest availability, and highest cost, media supplied.",Stub file
